## Project Goals

My goals have been to:
1) develop a website which 
2) enables me to demonstrate newly learned javascript skills, 
3) courtesy of the Code Institute (codeinstitute.com). 
4) Following initial review of recommended options, 
5) I began researching financial charting of securities, and 
6) simple text based adventure gaming web development. 
7) I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA which 
8) looks like the right way to go,
9) so I have developed my game on that basis, and extended the features.
10) utilising Javascript, HTML and CSS, with 
11) Bootstrap's powerful, feature-packed frontend toolkit.

### Project Additional Goals

12) I have decided to add a keyboard fight sequence at the end of the game
13) so i will create the player (adding the option to name the player) and enemy (gaoler)
14) I will move player and enemy with event listeners for arrow keys
15) add attacking keys ASD
16) add health bar
17) game timers and game over

* [Back to top of README.md](#about-my-project) 

-   ### Process Flow
    -   I have developed the game with a process flow as the basis for the game logic and supporting JavaScript.
    -   I do also want to refine the keyboard handling and visualisation of player and gaoler health for the battle to escape.
    -   A diagram of the process flow is <details><summary>here.</summary>
    <img src="./assets/images/processflow.PNG">  
    </details> 

-   ### Responsiveness
    -   I have developed the game to be responsive on mobile devices and browsers.
    -   As the manual testing section will show, i have successfully deployed responsive initial and subsequent stages of the game.
    -   Screenshots of the responsiveness are <details><summary>here.</summary>
    <img src="./assets/docs/responsivenesstestingscreen1.PNG">  
    </details> and <details><summary>here.</summary>

    </details> 
    
-   ### Imagery
    -   I am working to find images to choose that will be eye-catching, informative and bright.  The colours in the images will be chosen to help convey a sense of adventure and excitement. The images will show Adventure participants to align with the main story line of the adventure. They will be chosen to ensure the site is clear and easy to use.

    - Social media icon images from https://github.com/techtycho/microsoft-homepage-clone/tree/master/img
    - JPG to avif from https://convertio.co/jpg-avif/ 
    - Colors from http://www.paletton.com/ 

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A palette have been chosen to convey a sense of adventure. 
    An image of the palette is <details><summary>here.</summary>

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts are being used to import Oswald fonts into assests\css\style.css. 

-   ### Wireframes

### Known bugs

- None currently identified.
- Over the course of the project, 
    1) various layout issues with 
        - horizontal scrolling and more
    2)  let textItem = textItems.find(o => o.item === TextItemNumber)
        - took a while to get this array find code to work
        - typo in o.item member name took a while to pin down (looking in the wrong place) 
        - o is a placeholder and => is a function pointer
        - helpful demo here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12462318/find-a-value-in-an-array-of-objects-in-javascript
    3)  had fun trying to add visuals for buttons and scenes.
        - found helpful code here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9415851/how-to-change-the-background-image-of-a-button-using-javascript)
