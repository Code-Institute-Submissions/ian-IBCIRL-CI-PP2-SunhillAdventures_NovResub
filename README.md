## Project Goals

My goals have been to:
1) develop a website which 
2) enables me to demonstrate newly learned javascript skills, 
3) courtesy of the Code Institute (codeinstitute.com). 
4) Following initial review of recommended options, 
5) I began researching financial charting of securities, and 
6) simple text based adventure gaming web development. 
7) I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA which 
8) looks like the right way to go,
9) so I have developed my game on that basis, and extended the features.
10) utilising Javascript, HTML and CSS, with 
11) Bootstrap's powerful, feature-packed frontend toolkit.
