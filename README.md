## Project Goals

My goals have been to:
1) develop a website which 
2) enables me to demonstrate newly learned javascript skills, 
3) courtesy of the Code Institute (codeinstitute.com). 
4) Following initial review of recommended options, 
5) I began researching financial charting of securities, and 
6) simple text based adventure gaming web development. 
7) I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA which 
8) looks like the right way to go,
9) so I have developed my game on that basis, and extended the features.
10) utilising Javascript, HTML and CSS, with 
11) Bootstrap's powerful, feature-packed frontend toolkit.

* [Back to top of README.md](#about-my-project) 

-   ### Imagery
    -   I am working to find images to choose that will be eye-catching, informative and bright.  The colours in the images will be chosen to help convey a sense of adventure and excitement. The images will show Adventure participants to align with the main story line of the adventure. They will be chosen to ensure the site is clear and easy to use.

    - Social media icon images from https://github.com/techtycho/microsoft-homepage-clone/tree/master/img
    - JPG to avif from https://convertio.co/jpg-avif/ 
    - Colors from 

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A palette will be chosen to convey a sense of adventure. An image of the palette is <details><summary>here.</summary>
