3) courtesy of the Code Institute (codeinstitute.com). 
4) Following initial review of recommended options, 
5) I began researching financial charting of securities, and 
6) simple text based adventure gaming web development. 
7) I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA which

11) Bootstrap's powerful, feature-packed frontend toolkit.
